# genshin-honkai_pulling_simulation
An Programm to simulate an pull in Genshin Impact (Wishes) or Honkai: Star Rail (Warps).

# Description
After the new Game Honkai: Star Rail was released (where you can pull on "warps" to get items) I wanted to get some infos about the odds of pulling spesific items. So I wrote this program to simulate the System out of the Game. It was pretty fun. I learned somethings about arrays and some other stuff.
